# JavaScript Principles

!!! quote "Will Sentance - Frontend Masters"
    "JavaScript has a thread of execution that goes through our code line by line and executes each line."

## 🎯 Section Overview

**Thread of Execution, Functions, Call Stack, Global Context**

Master the fundamental execution model of JavaScript with the most important and unique resources. This section covers how JavaScript processes your code behind the scenes.

## 🔍 What You'll Learn

### Core Concepts

- **Thread of Execution**: How JavaScript processes code line by line
- **Functions**: Code storage, invocation, and execution context creation  
- **Call Stack**: Tracking function execution order and memory management
- **Global Context**: The default execution environment

### Deep Understanding

- **Memory Allocation**: How variables and functions are stored
- **Execution Context**: The environment where code executes
- **Hoisting**: Variable and function declaration processing
- **Scope Chain**: How JavaScript resolves variable access

    Bridges synchronous execution with asynchronous patterns comprehensively.

## 🎯 Learning Path

### 1. Foundation (Beginner)
Start with **Will Sentance's Frontend Masters** lesson to build the correct mental model.

### 2. Specification (Intermediate)  
Read **MDN Official Documentation** for authoritative understanding.

### 3. Deep Dive (Advanced)
Study the **Deep Mechanisms** articles for comprehensive coverage.

### 4. Implementation (Expert)
Explore **Engine-Level Technical** resources for V8 internals.

## 🔗 Topic Deep Dives

### [Thread of Execution](thread-of-execution.md)
How JavaScript processes code line by line in a single thread.

### [Functions](functions.md)  
Function storage, invocation, and execution context creation.

### [Call Stack](call-stack.md)
LIFO structure tracking function execution and memory management.

## 💡 Key Mental Models

### The Thread Metaphor
Think of JavaScript execution like a thread weaving through your code:
- **Single-threaded**: Only one line executes at a time
- **Sequential**: Code runs line by line, top to bottom
- **Contextual**: Each function creates its own execution context

### The Call Stack Visualization
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Function C    │ ← Currently executing
├─────────────────┤
│   Function B    │ ← Waiting
├─────────────────┤
│   Function A    │ ← Waiting  
├─────────────────┤
│ Global Context  │ ← Base level
└─────────────────┘
```

### Memory Allocation Process
1. **Creation Phase**: Variables hoisted, functions stored
2. **Execution Phase**: Code runs line by line
3. **Cleanup Phase**: Execution context destroyed when function returns

## 🎨 Visual Learning

The resources in this section include:
- **Animated diagrams** showing execution flow
- **Memory visualization** of variable storage
- **Step-by-step breakdowns** of code execution
- **Interactive examples** demonstrating concepts
