# Quality Standards

!!! abstract "Maintaining Excellence"
    These standards ensure every resource in our collection provides exceptional value for deep JavaScript learning.

## üéØ Core Quality Criteria

### **1. Deep and Technical** ‚öôÔ∏è
Resources must go beyond surface-level explanations:

- **Explains "why"** not just "how"
- **Covers internal mechanisms** and implementation details
- **References specifications** or engine behavior
- **Provides mental models** for understanding

#### ‚úÖ Good Examples:
- Jake Archibald's event loop guide with spec references
- Kyle Simpson's "You Don't Know JS" series
- Lydia Hallie's visualized explanations with internals

#### ‚ùå Poor Examples:
- Basic syntax tutorials without depth
- Copy-paste code examples without explanation
- Surface-level overviews

### **2. Unique Value** üíé
Each resource must offer something distinctive:

- **Novel perspective** on familiar concepts
- **Unique teaching approach** (visual, interactive, etc.)
- **Specialized focus** on specific aspects
- **Expert insights** not found elsewhere

#### ‚úÖ Good Examples:
- Visual explanations that make complex concepts clear
- Specification-level analysis of language features
- Performance optimization insights from engine developers

#### ‚ùå Poor Examples:
- Duplicate content already well-covered
- Generic tutorials available everywhere
- Rehashed explanations without new insights

### **3. Expert Authors** üë®‚Äçüíª

- **JavaScript educators** (Will Sentance, Kyle Simpson)
- **Browser/Engine developers** (V8 team, Mozilla)
- **Framework creators** (Dan Abramov, Evan You)
- **Specification contributors** (TC39 members)
- **Recognized technical writers** with proven expertise

#### ‚úÖ Recognized Experts:
- Will Sentance (Frontend Masters)
- Kyle Simpson (You Don't Know JS)
- Lydia Hallie (JavaScript Visualized)
- Jake Archibald (Google Chrome team)
- Dan Abramov (React team)

### **4. Well-Explained** üìö
Content must be clear and comprehensive:

- **Logical progression** of concepts

- **Proper terminology** and precise language
- **Complete coverage** of the topic

#### Quality Indicators:
- Step-by-step breakdowns
- Code examples with line-by-line explanations
- Diagrams and visualizations
- Common pitfalls and debugging tips

### **5. Relevant to Course Structure** üéì
Resources must align with our learning objectives:

- **Fits within** Frontend Masters course topics
- **Supports deep understanding** of JavaScript fundamentals
- **Builds toward mastery** of hard concepts
- **Connects to** other course sections

## üìä Resource Type Standards

### **Visual Understanding** üé®
- **Animated explanations** with step-by-step progression
- **Interactive elements** that aid comprehension
- **Clear visual metaphors** for abstract concepts
- **Accurate representations** of internal processes

### **Deep Mechanisms** üî¨
- **Specification references** to ECMA-262 or browser specs
- **Implementation details** from JavaScript engines
- **Memory management** and performance implications
- **Edge cases** and browser differences

### **Engine-Level Technical** ‚öôÔ∏è
- **V8, SpiderMonkey, or JavaScriptCore** implementation details
- **Compilation and optimization** strategies
- **Performance benchmarks** and analysis
- **Debugging techniques** for engine-level issues

### **Official Documentation** üìñ
- **MDN Web Docs** comprehensive guides
- **ECMA-262 specification** sections
- **Browser vendor** documentation
- **Standards body** publications

## üö´ Exclusion Criteria

### **Automatic Rejections:**
- **Basic syntax tutorials** without depth
- **Promotional content** disguised as education
- **Outdated information** (pre-ES6 without historical context)
- **Plagiarized content** or copyright violations
- **Poor quality** writing or presentation

### **Content We Don't Need:**
- **Framework-specific** tutorials (React, Vue, etc.)
- **Library documentation** (jQuery, Lodash, etc.)
- **Build tool** configurations (Webpack, Babel, etc.)
- **General programming** concepts not JavaScript-specific
